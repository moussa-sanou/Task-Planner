Task Planner is a web app that stores and displays a task. The user after opening the app will see space to enter the task or event name, the due date, and the screen that displays the store information. The user can delete a single task by using the delete link attached to each task or click on the Clear all button to clear all the tasks. The task planner was developed using JAVASCRIPT and the user interface using HTML and CSS.
